<h1> Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies </h1>
<h3>These pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are perfect for those of us who love all things pumpkin pie and chocolate. These cake-like cookies are always a big hit. I think they taste best when they are cold from the refrigerator.</h3>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Pumpkin: Use store-bought canned pumpkin or homemade pumpkin puree. </li>
    <li>Sugar: A cup of white sugar lends the perfect amount of sweetness. </li>
    <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends moisture without imparting flavor. </li>
    <li>Egg: An egg adds even more moisture and helps bind the dough together. </li>
    <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise. </li>
    <li>Milk: Dissolving the baking soda in milk speeds up the leavening process. </li>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the pumpkin chocolate chip cookie dough structure. </li>
    <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds warmth to the sugary sweet cookies</li>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookie dough. </li>
    <li>Walnuts: Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
    <li>Chocolate: Youâ€™ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. </li>
    <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
